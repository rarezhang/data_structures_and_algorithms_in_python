# p 608 
# Boyer-Moore algorithm O(m*n) 
# avoid comparisons between P and a sizable fraction of the characters in T
# improve the running time of the brute-force algorithm by adding two potential time-saving heuristics 
#   - looking-glass heuristic: when testing a possible placement of P against T, begin the comparisons from the end of P and move backward to the front of P  
#   - character-jump heuristic: During the testing of a possible placement of P within T, a mismatch of text character T[i]=c with the corresponding pattern character P[k] is handled as follows. If c is not contained anywhere in P, then shift P completely past T[i] (for it cannot match any character in P). Otherwise, shift P until an occurrence of character c in P gets aligned with T[i]
